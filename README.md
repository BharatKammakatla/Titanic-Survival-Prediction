# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
ðŸ›³ Machine Learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

This notebook builds a ML algorithm to predict which passengers are survived during Titanic shipwreck. We will use python based machine learning libraries, pandas, numpy to build the model.

## Problem
Create a Machine Learning model to predict survivors in Titanic shipwerck.

## Data
Data is taken from Kaggle competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

## Evaluation
Evaluation metric is accuracy. That is the percentage of passengers we correctly predicted.
